= Mod_memc_sess

Mod_memc_sess is an Apache module designed to provide a simple access control which checks the login sessions stored in the Memcached.  The module retrieves the session key from the cookie and checks whether the session key is stored in the Memcached.  If the session doesn't exist there, the module forbids the HTTP request. 


== Software Dependencies

The module was built and tested on the following libraries:

- libapr1 - 1.3.8
- libapreq2 - 2.08
- apache2 (prefork MPM) - 2.2.12
- libmemcached - 0.31-1

This module doesn't work on multithread, so you can't use it with worker MPM.


== Instration

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ sudo make install

or

 $ sudo apxs -i -c mod_memc_sess.c

And add the following directive to your httpd.conf to load the module.

 LoadModule memc_sess_module /path/to/mod_memc_sess.so


== Summary of Supported Directives

MemcSessServer host:port

- These are the hostname (or IP address) of the Memcached storing the sessions, and the TCP port number listend by the Memcashed.
 
MemcSessCookieKey cookie_key

- The name of cookie key that related with the session key. For example, if you recieve the cookie "Cookie: foo_session_id=1234abcd5678" and it stores a session key "1234abcd5678", you should set "MemcSessCookieKey foo_session_id".

MemcSessMemcKeyPrefix key_prefix

- This is optional. This key_prefix is used as a prefix of Memcached query key. For example, if you set "MemcSessMemcKeyPrefix bar_session:" and the session key is "1234abcd5678", the query for Memcached is "bar_session:1234abcd5678".
